ABSTRACT 
The difficulties 
to be met with 
the 
resolu- 
tion 
of syntactical 
ambiguity 
in MT can be 
at 
least 
partially 
overcome 
by means of preserving 
the 
syntactical 
ambiguity 
of the 
source 
language 
into 
the 
target 
language. 
An extensive 
study 
of the 
co- 
rrespondences 
between 
the 
syntactically 
ambiguous 
structures 
in English 
and Bulgarian 
has 
provided 
a 
solid 
empirical 
basis 
in favor 
of such 
an approach. 
Similar 
results 
could 
be expected 
for 
other 
suffi- 
ciently 
related 
languages 
as well. 
The paper 
con- 
centrates 
on the 
linguistic 
grounds 
for 
adopting 
the 
approach 
proposed. 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Syntactical amblgulty, as part of the ambigui- 
ty problem in general, is widely recognized as a 
major 
difficulty 
in MT. To solve 
this 
problem, 
the 
efforts of computational linguists have been main- 
ly directed 
to the process 
of analysis: 
a unique 
analysis 
is 
searched 
(semantical 
and/or 
world 
knowledge 
information 
being 
basically 
employed 
to 
this 
end), 
and only 
having 
obtained 
such 
an ana- 
lysis, 
it 
is proceeded 
to the 
process 
of synthesis. 
On this 
approach, 
in addition 
to the 
well 
known 
difficulties 
of general-linguistic 
and computa- 
tional 
character, 
there 
are 
two principle 
embarras- 
ments 
to he encountered. 
It 
makes us entirely 
in- 
capable 
to process, 
first, 
sentences 
with 
"unre- 
solvable 
syntactical 
ambiguity" 
(with 
respect 
to 
the 
disambiguation 
information 
stored), 
and, 
se- 
condly, 
sentences 
which must he translated 
ambi- 
guously 
(e.g. 
puns 
and the 
like). 
In this 
paper, 
the burden 
of solution 
of the 
syntactical 
ambiguity 
problem 
is shifted 
from the 
domain of analysis 
to the 
domain of synthesis 
of 
sentences. 
Thus, 
instead 
of trying 
to resolve 
such 
ambiguities 
in the 
source 
language 
(SL), 
syntac- 
tically 
ambiguous 
sentences 
are 
synthesized 
in the 
target 
language 
(TL) which preserve 
their 
ambigui- 
ty, 
so that 
the 
user 
himself 
rather 
than 
the 
par- 
ser 
disambiguates 
the 
ambiguities 
in question. 
This way of handling syntactical ambiguity 
may be viewed as an illustration of a more gene- 
ral approach, outlined earlier (Penchev and Perl- 
cliev 1982, Pericliev 1983, Penchev and Perlcllev 
1984), concerned 
also 
with 
other 
types 
of ambt- 
guitles in the SL translated by means of syntacti- 
cal, and not 
only 
syntactical, 
ambiguity 
in the 
TL. 
In this 
paper, 
we will 
concentrate 
on the 
linguistics 
~rounds 
for 
adopting 
such 
a manner 
of 
handling 
of syntactical 
ambiguity 
in an English 
in- 
to Bulgarian 
translation 
system. 
2. 
PHILOSOPHY 
This 
approach 
may be viewed 
as an attempt 
to 
simulate 
the 
behavior 
of s man-translator 
who is 
linguistically 
very 
competent, 
but 
is 
quite 
unfa- 
miliar 
with 
the 
domain he is 
translating 
his 
texts 
from. 
Such a man-translator 
will 
be able 
to say 
what words 
in the 
original 
and in the 
translated 
sentence 
go together 
under 
all 
of the 
syntactica- 
lly 
admissible 
analyses; 
however, 
he will 
be, 
in 
general, 
unable 
to make a decision 
as to which 
of 
these 
parses 
"make sense". 
Our approach 
will 
be 
an obvious 
way out 
of this 
situation. 
And it 
is 
in 
fact 
not 
Infrequently 
employed 
in the 
everyday 
practice 
of more "smart" 
translators. 
We believe 
that 
the 
capacity 
of such 
transla- 
tors 
to produce 
quite 
intelligible 
translations 
is 
a fact 
that 
can have 
a very 
direct 
bearing 
on at 
least some trends in MT. Resolvlng syntactical am- 
biguity, or, to put it more accurately, evading 
syntactical ambiguity in MT following a similar 
human-like 
strategy 
is 
only 
one instance 
of this. 
There 
are 
two further 
points 
that 
should 
be 
made in connection 
with 
the 
approach 
discussed. 
We assume 
as more or less 
self-evident 
that: 
(i) 
MT should 
not 
be intended 
to explicate 
texts 
in the 
SL by means of texts 
in the 
TL as 
previous 
approaches 
imply, 
but 
should 
only 
tran- 
slate 
them, 
no matter 
how ambiguous 
they 
might 
happen 
to be; 
(ii) 
Since 
ambiguities 
almost 
always 
pass 
un- 
noticed 
in speech, 
the 
user 
will 
unconsciously 
dtsambtguate 
them (as 
in fact 
he would have 
done, 
had he read 
the 
text 
in the 
SL); 
this, 
in effect, 
will 
not 
diminish 
the 
quality 
of the 
translation 
in comparison 
with 
the 
original, 
at 
least 
insofar 
as ambiguity 
is 
concerned.

THE DESCRIPTION OF SYNTACTICAL AMBIGUITY 
IN ENGLISH AND BULGARIAN 
The empirical basis of the approach is provi- 
ded by an extensive study of syntactical ambiguity 
in English and Bulgarlan (Pericliev 19835, accom- 
plished within the framework of a version of de- 
pendency grammar using dependency arcs and bra- 
cketlngs. In this study, from a given llst of con- 
figurations for each language, all logically-ad- 
mlssible ambiguous strings of three types in En- 
gllsh and Bulgarian were calculated. The first 
type of syntactlcally ambiguous strings is of the 
form: 
(15 
A ~L~B, 
e.g. 
adv.mod(how long?) 
f 
The statistician 
studied(V) 
the ~hole year(PP), 
obj.dir(wh~t?) 
where A, B, ... 
are complexes of word-classes, 
"---~" 
is a dependency arc, 
and 1, 2, 
... 
are syn- 
tactical 
relations. 
The second type is of the form: 
(2) 
A -~->B<-~- C, e.g. 
adv.mod(how?) 
She greeted(V) the girl(N) ~ith a smil6(PP) 
attrib(what?) 
The third 
type is of the form: 
(3) 
A -!-~B~-~- C, e.g. 
adv.mod(how?) 
[ 
He failed(V) 
enttrely(Adv) 
to cheat(Vin f) her 
adv.mod(how?) 
It was found, first, 
that 
almost all 
logically 
-admissible 
strings 
of the three 
types are actually 
realized 
in both languages 
(cf. 
the same result 
al- 
so for Russian in JordanskaJa 
(1967)5. 
Secondly, 
and more important, 
there 
turned 
out to be a stri- 
king coincidence 
between the strings 
in English 
and 
Bulgarian; 
the latter 
was to he expected 
from the 
coincidence 
of configurations 
in both languages 
as 
well as from their 
sufficiently 
similar 
global 
syntactic 
organization.

TRANSLATIONAL PROBLEMS 
With a view to the aims of translation, it 
was convenient to distinguish two cases: Case A, in 
which to each syntactically ambiguous string in En- 
glish corresponds a syntactically ambiguous string 
in Bulgarlan, and Case B, in which to some English 
strings do not correspond any Bulgarian ones; 
Case A provides a possibility for literal English 
into Bulgarian translation, while there is no such 
possibillty for sentences containing strings 
classed under Case B. 
4.1. 
Case A: Literal Translation 
English strings which can be literally tran- 
slated into Bulgarian comprise,roughly speaking, 
the majority and the most common of strings to 
appear In real English texts. Informally, these 
strings can be included into several large groups 
of syntactically ambiguous constructions, such as 
constructions with "floating" word-classes (Ad- 
verbs, Prepositional Phrases, etc. acting as slaves 
either to one, or to another master-word), constru- 
ctions with prepositional 
and post-positional 
ad- 
juncts 
to conjoined 
groups, 
constructions 
with se- 
veral 
conjoined 
members, constructions 
with symmet- 
rical 
predicates, 
some elliptical 
constructions, 
etc. 
Due to space limitations, 
a few English 
phra- 
ses with their 
literal 
translations 
will 
suffice 
as an illustration 
of Case A. (Further 
on, syntac- 
tical 
relations as labels of arcs will be omitted 
where superfluous in marking the ambiguity):

4.2. 
Case 
B: Non-Literal Translation 
English strings 
which cannot be literally 
translated 
into Bulgarian are such strings 
which 
contain: 
(i) word-classes 
(V i f 
Gerund) not pre- 
n ' 
sent in Bulgarian, 
and/or 
(ii) syntactical 
relations (e.g. "composite": language~-~ -- theory, 
etc.) not present in Bulgarian, and/or 
(iii) other 
differences (in global syntactical organization, 
agreement, etc. ). 
It will be shown how certain English strings 
falling under this heading are related to Bulgarian 
strings preserving their ambiguity. A way to over- 
come difficulties with (il) and (iii) is exempli- 
fied on a very common (complex) string, vlz. 
Adj/N/Prt+N/N's+N (e.g. stylish ~entlemen's suits). 
As an illustration, here we confine to prob- 
lems to be met with (i), and, more concretely, to 
such English strings containing Vin f. These strings 
are mapped onto Bulgarian strings 
containing 
da-construction or a verbal noun (V i ~ generally 
b-eeing translated either way). E.g. 
nXthe Vln f in 
obj. dlr 
(8) a. He promised(V) to please(Vin f) mother 
t._JI 
. 
eL. 
adv. mod 
(promised what or why?) is rendered by a da-con- 
struction in agreement with the subject, preserving 
the ambiguity: 
obj. dir 
~,'" 
I[ 
~1 
' 
zaradva(da-const r) 
objelht a (V) da 
b. T~J 
. 
~ 
I 
__ 
m~Jka 
adv. mod 
In the string 
attrib 
(9) a. ~ have(V)jl, instructions(N)~, toj st~dy(Vin 
f
)
j
 
obJ.dlr 
(what instructions 
or I have to study what?) V. _ 
can be rendered alternatively 
by a d_~a-construc ~nz- 
tion or by a prepositional 
verbal noun: 
attrib 
b. AZ imam(V) lnstruktsii(N) 
da ucha(d__aa-constr) 
ohj dir 
attrib 
c. 
instruktsii(N) 
za uchene(PrVblN) 
obj. dl r 
J 
Yet in other strings, 
e.g. The chicken(N) is 
ready(Adj) to eat(V. .) (the chicken eats or is 
eaten.), 
in order to 
preserve the ambiguity the 
infinitive 
should be rendered by a prepositional 
verbal noun: Pileto(N) e gotovo(AdJ) z_~a jadene 
(PrVblN), rather 
than with the finite 
da-construc- 
tion, 
since in the latter 
case we would obtain 
two unambiguous translations: 
Pileto 
e gotovo d a 
~ade (the chicken eats) 
or Pileto 
e got ovo da se 
~ade (the chicken is eaten), 
and so on. 
For some English strings 
no syntactically 
am- 
biguous Bulgarian strings 
could be put into corres- 
pondence, so that a translation 
with our method 
proved to be an impossibility. 
E.g. 
predicative 
V~--7 I[ ob~ .dir 
~ 
(I0) He found(V) the mechanic(N) a helper(N) 
~ 
Jl~bJ.indir 
~ 
t 
obJ.dir 
(either 
the mechanic or someone else is the helper) 
is such a sentence due to the impossibility 
in Bul- 
garian~r 
two non-prepositional 
objects, 
a direct 
and an indirect 
one, to appear in a sentence. 
4.3. 
Mul~,,iple Syntactical 
Ambiguity 
Many very frequently encountered cases of mul- 
tiple 
syntactical 
ambiguity can also be handled 
successfully 
within this approach. E.g. a phrase 
like Cybernetical 
devices and systems for automatic 
control and dia~nosis in biomedicine with more than 
30 possible parsings 
is amenable to literal 
trans- 
lation 
into Bulgarian. 
4.4. 
Semantically Irrelevant 
Syntactical 
Ambi~uity 
Disambiguating syntactical 
ambiguity is an im- 
portant 
task in MT only because different 
meanings 
are usually associated 
with the different 
syntac- 
tical 
descriptions. 
This, however, is not always 
the case. There are some constructions 
in English 
the syntactical 
ambiguity of which cannot lead to 
multiple understanding. 
E.g. in sentences of the 
form A is not B (He is not happy), in which the ad- 
verbial 
particle 
not is either 
a verbal negation 
(He isn't 
happy) or a non-verbal negation (He's not 
happy), the different 
syntactical 
trees will be in- 
terpreted 
semantically 
as synonymous: 'A is not B' 
~-==~A is not-B'. 
523 
We should not worry about finding Bulgarlan 
syntactically ambiguous correspondences for such 
English constructions. 
We can choose arbitrarily 
one analysis, since either of the syntactical des- 
criptions will provide correct information for 
our translational purposes. Indeed, the construc- 
tion above has no ambiguous Bulgarian correspon- 
dence: in Bulgarian the negating particle combines 
either 
with the verb (then it is written 
as a se- 
parate 
word) or with the adjective 
(in which case 
it is prefixed 
to it). 
Either 
construction, 
how- 
ever, will yield 
a correct 
translation: 
To~ nee 
== -- 
radosten 
or 
To~ e neradosten. 
4.5. 
A Lexical Problem 
Certain 
difficulties 
may arise, 
having managed 
to map English syntactically 
ambiguous strings 
onto 
ambiguous Bulgarian 
ones. These difficulties 
are 
due to the different 
behavior 
of certain 
English 
lexemes in comparison to their 
Bulgarian 
equiva- 
lents. 
This behavior 
is displayed 
in the phenomenon 
we call 
"intralingual 
lexical-resolution 
of syn- 
tactical 
ambiguity" 
(the substitution 
of lexemes 
in the SL 
with their 
translational 
equivalents 
from the TL results 
in the resolution 
of the syn- 
tactical 
ambiguity). 
For instance, 
in spite 
of the existence 
of am- 
biguous strings 
in both languages of the form 
Verbtr/itr~->Noun, 
with some particular 
le- 
xemes (e.g. 
shoot~r/itr==-~>zastrel~amtr 
or 
strel~amitr), 
In which to One Engllsh 
lexeme co- 
rrespond two in Bulgarian 
(one only transitive, 
and 
the other only intransitive), 
the ambiguity in the 
translation 
will be lost. 
This situation 
explains 
why it seems impossible 
to translate 
ambiguously 
into Bulgarian 
examples containing 
verbs of the 
type given, 
or verbal 
nouns formed from such verbs, 
as the case is in The shootin~ of the hunters. 
This problem, however, could be generally 
tackled 
in the translation 
into Bulgarian, 
since it is a 
language usually 
providing 
a series 
of forms for a 
verb: transitive, 
intransitive, 
and transitive/in- 
transitive, 
which are more or less synonymous ~for 
more details, 
cf. Penchev and Perlcliev 
(1984)). 
5. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
To conclude, some syntactically ambiguous 
strings in English can have literal, others non-ll- 
teral, and still others do not have any correspon- 
dences in Bulgarian. In summary, from a total num- 
ber of approximately 200 simple strings treated in 
Engllsh more than 3/4 can, and only 1/4 cannot, be 
literally translated; about half of the latter 
strings can be put into correspondence with syntac- 
tically ambiguous strings in Bulgarian preserving 
their ambiguity. This gives quite a strong support 
to the usefulness of our approach in an English in- 
to Bulgarian translation system. 
Several 
advantages of this way of handling of 
syntactical 
ambiguity can be mentioned. 
First, in the processing of the majority of 
syntactically ambiguous sentences within an En- 
glish into Bulgarian translation system it dispen- 
ses with semantical and world knowledge information 
at the very low cost of studying the ambiguity co- 
rrespondences in both languages. It could be expec- 
ted that investigations along this line will prove 
to be frultful for other pairs of languages as 
well. 
Secondly, whenever this 
way of handling 
syn- 
tactical 
ambiguity is applicable, 
the impossibili- 
ty of previous 
approaches 
to translate 
sentences 
with unresolvable 
ambiguity, 
or such with verbal 
Jokes and the like, 
turns 
out to be an easily 
attainable 
task. 
Thirdly, 
the approach seems to have a very na- 
tural 
extension 
to another principal 
difficulty 
in 
MT, viz. 
coreference 
(cf. 
the three-ways 
ambiguity 
of Jim hit 
John and then he (Jim, John or neither?) 
went away 
and the same ambiguity of tQ~ (=he) in 
its 
literal 
translation 
into Bulgarian: 
D$im udari 
DJon i togava toj(?) 
si otide). 
And, finally, there is yet another reason for 
adopting the approach discussed here. Even if we 
choose to go another way and (somehow) dlsamblgu- 
ate sentences in the SL, almost certainly their 
translational equivalents will be again syntactl- 
cally 
ambiguous, and quite 
probably preserve 
the 
very ambiguity we tried 
to resolve. 
In this 
sense, 
for the purposes 
of MT (or 
other man-oriented 
applications 
of CL) we need not waste our efforts 
to disambiguate 
e.g. 
sentences 
like John hit 
the 
dog with th___ee lon~ hat or John hit th____ee do~ with the 
long woo1, since, 
even if we have done that, 
the 
correct 
Bulgarian 
translations 
of both these sen- 
tences 
are syntactically 
ambiguous in exactly 
the 
same way, the resolution 
of ambiguity thus proving 
to be an entirely 
superfluous 
operation 
(cf. 
D~on 
udari kucheto s dal~ata 
palka and Djon udari ku- 
cheto s dal~ata 
valna).
