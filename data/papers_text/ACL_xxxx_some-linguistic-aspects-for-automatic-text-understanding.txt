ABSTRACT 
This paper proposes a system 
of map- 
ping classes of 
syntactic 
structures 
as 
instruments 
for 
automatic 
text 
under- 
standing. 
The system illustrated in Japa- 
nese consists of a set of verb classes and 
information on mapping them together 
with 
noun phrases, tense and 
aspect. 
The sys- 
tem. having information 
on 
direction 
of 
possible 
inferences 
between 
the 
verb 
classes with information on tense and 
as- 
pect, is supposed to be utilized 
for rea- 
soning in automatic text understanding. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this paper is 
to pro- 
pose a system of mapping classes 
of 
syn- 
tactic structures as instruments for auto- 
matic text understanding. 
The system con- 
sists of a set of verb classes 
and Jnfor- 
matlon on mapping them together with 
noun 
phrases, tense and aspect, and ]s supposed 
to he utilized for inference in 
automatic 
text understanding. 
The language 
used 
for 
illustration 
of 
the 
system 
is Japanese. 
There Is a tendency for non-syntactic 
analysers and semantic grammars 
In 
auto- 
matic 
text 
understanding. 
However. this 
proposal 
Is motivated 
by 
the 
fact that 
syntactic structures, 
once 
analyzed 
and 
classified in terms of 
semantic 
related- 
ness, provide much information 
for" under- 
standing. 
This is supported 
by 
the fact 
that human 
beings 
use 
syntactically re- 
lated 
sentences 
when 
they ask questions 
about texts. 
The system we are proposing 
has 
the 
following elements: 
1) 
Verb classes. 
2) 
Mapping of noun phrases between 
or among some verb 
classes. 
3) 
Direction of possible infel'ence 
between the 
classes 
with 
information on 
tense and aspect. 
Our experiment, 
in which subjects are 
asked 
to make true-false questions 
about 
certain texts, revealed that native speak- 
ers think that they 
understand 
texts 
by 
deducting sentences lexically 
or semanti- 
cally related. For instance, a human being 
relates questions such as 
'Did Mary go to 
a theater?' to a sentence in texts such as 
'John took Mary to a theater.' 
Or, by the 
same sentence, he understands 
that 
'Mary 
was in the theater." 
II. FEATURES OF THE JAPANESE SYNTAX 
Features of ,Japanese syntax 
relevant 
to the discussion 
in this paper 
are pre- 
sented below. 
The sentence usually 
ha:# case mark- 
ings as postpositions to noun phrases. For 
instance. 
I. John qa Mary D_J_ himitsu o hanashita 
'John told a secret to Mary.' 
In 
sentence 
1. 
postpositions 
ga. 
ni 
and 
o 
indicate 
nominative, 
dative 
alld accusa- 
tive. 
respectively. 
409 
However. 
postposJtions 
do not unique- 
{y map to deep cases. 
Take the followitlg 
sentences 
for 
example. 
2. 
John 
~ia_ sanii 
B i_ itta. 
"John 
went 
at 
:? o'cio(-k.' 
3. 
John 
w_a Tokyo 
r!t 
itta. 
"John 
~,~'ellt 
to Tokyo." 
4. 
Johr~ w;~ Tokyo 
ILI :~undeiru. 
'John 
lives 
in Tokyo.' 
Ni in the sentences 2, 3. 4 indicate time. 
goal and location, r e s p e c t i v e l y .  This is 
due to 
the verb 
ca|egory 
(3 and 
41 
OF the 
class 
of noun 
phrases 
(2 and 
31 
appearing 
in 
each 
sentence. 
Certain 
mor'phemc 
classes 
hide the 
casemark ing. e.g. 
5. John 
~Q itta. 
"John also 
went (y;omewhere). 
6. Tokyo mo i t t a .  
'Someone went to Tokyo also.' 
The mo in sentence 5 and 6 
means 
' a l s o ' .  
Therefore these sentences are derived from 
d i f f e r e n t  s y n t a c t i c a l  c o n s t r u c t i o n s ,  that 
is. 
sentences 7 and 8. r e s p e c t i v e l y .  
7. John ga itta. 
"John went (somewhere).' 
8. Tokyo n__ki itta. 
• Someone 
went 
to 
Tokyo." 
Furthermore. as 
i l l u s t r a t e d  
in sen- 
tences 
5 
through 6, noun phrases ,lay be 
deleted f r e e l y ,  
provided 
the 
context 
gives f u l l  information. In sentences 6 and 
7. 
a noun phrase 
indicating the goal is 
missing and sentences 6 and 
8 
lack thal 
indicating the 
subject. 
Finally. 
there 
are many pairs 
of 
lexicalLy 
related 
verbs, 
tz'ansi t ire 
and 
inst] a~it ire, 
indicating 
the :;ame phenomenon 
differently 
9. 
John ga t,4ary ni hon 
o m_!seta. 
",h)hn showed a hook to Mary. 
10. Mal'y ga hon o !~ita. 
"Uary saw a book.' 
The two expressions, or viewpoints, on the 
same phenomenon, that is, 
'John showed to 
Mary a book 
which she saw.' 
are 
related 
in Japanese by the verb root ~_l. 
The system 
under 
consideration uti- 
lizes some 
of 
the 
above 
features (case 
marking 
and lexically related verbs) 
and 
in turn 
can be used 
to ease difficulties 
of automatic understanding, caused by some 
other 
features 
(case hiding, 
ambiguious 
case 
marking 
and 
d e l e t i o n  
of 
noun 
p h r a s e s . )  
III. VERB CLASS 
The system is i l l u s t r a t e d  below 
with 
verbs r e l a t e d  
to the notion of movement. 
The verb c l a s s e s  in t h i s  category are 
as 
follows: 
(1) 
Verb class of causality of 
movementtCM) 
Examples:tsureteiku ' t o  take (a 
person)' 
tsuretekuru 'to bring (a 
person)" 
hakobu 'to carry" 
yaru 'to give" 
oshieru "to tell' 
Verbs of t h i s  c l a s s  indicate that someone 
causes something or someone moves. 
How to 
move varies as seen later. 
(2) Verb c l a s s  of movement(MV) 
Examples:iku "to go' 
kuru 
'to 
come" 
idousuru "to move" 
Verbs 
of t h i s  c l a s s  indicated that some- 
thing or someone moves from one place to 
another. 
(3) Verb class of existence(EX) 
Examples:iru '(animate) be" 
aru "(inanimate) be' 
Verbs of t h i s  c l a s s  indicate the existence 
of something or someone. 
410 
(4) Verb class of possesslon(PS) 
Examples:motsu 'to 
possess' 
kau 'to keep' 
Verbs 
of 
this 
class 
indicate someone's 
possession of something or someone. 
the case slot. 
As seen below, the differ- 
ence between yaru, 'to give' and uru, 
'to 
sell' 
is 
that the latter has 'money' 
as 
instrument, while the former does not. In- 
cidentally, 
Japanese 
has 
a verb 
yuzuru 
which 
can 
be used whether 
the 
instruh~ent 
Is money or not. 
Notice 
that 
the 
fundamental 
notion 
of 
MOVE here 
is 
much wider 
than 
the 
normal 
meaning 
of the word 'move'. 
When someone 
learns 
some idea 
from someone else. 
it 
is 
understood 
that 
an abstract 
notion 
moves 
from the 
former 
to the 
latter. 
IV. MAPPING OF SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES 
Furthermore, 
verbs 
of each class 
dif- 
fer 
slightly

structures.

inference would be 
possible among sen- 
tences II through 14 in automatic text un- 
derstanding. Furthermore. this system can 
also be 
u t i l i z e d  in 
the 
automatic text 
understanding by 
locating missing noun 
phrases and determining ambiguous grammat- 
ical cases in the sentence, finding seman- 
t i c a l l y  r e l a t e d  sentences 
between 
the 
questions and the t e x t ,  
and gathering the 
right semantic information. 
By the~ie conditions, the mapping 
of 
s y n t a c t i c  s t r u c t u r e s  presented in Diagram 
II is transformed to that in 
terms of in- 
dividual verbs. 
Furthermore, rules of d i -  
rections 
for reasoning presented 
in Dia- 
gram IV connect s p e c i f i c  sentences. 
Take the following 
sentence 
for 
example. 
Since t h i s  system uses information on 
s y n t a c t i c  s t r u c t u r e s ,  it is 
much simpler 
in terms 
of the semantic s t r u c t u r e s  than 
the Conceptual Dependencey Model, 
for in- 
stance, and the mapping among the sentence 
patterns semantically r e l a t e d  much more
